    """
    Helper that makes ZMQ socket. We do this in many places, with different variations on bind or connect, ip, and port
    so it's nice to have a helper function to do it, especially there's lots of lines that need to be read in order
    to understand what's going on every time we make a socket. This is made for only PUB and SUB sockets, ZMQ has other
    options but they don't suit our needs.
    ZMQ docs for our team: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J_Gdc7iPWV1LekobKUTpKMzVt-vNSunPHbohVICuwz4/

    Args:
        ip: ip address. Probably 1 of: 0.0.0.0 (same as *), 127.0.0.1 (same as localhost), the remote server IP, or
            the local computer's IP
        port: Port that the socket will be bound to or connected to, e.g. 5557. Our system has one publisher and one subscriber for
            each port.
        parent_name: Just the name of the class that made this, for logging purposes
        bind_or_connect: Whether to bind or connect the socket. It's harder to bind to a remote server from a local
                        computer, so generally the server binds itself and the plane and ground connect to it.
                        Read the docs above for more info.
        pub_or_sub: Whether this socket is a publisher or subscriber.
        context: zmq context, if a context is passed in, we use that, otherwise we make a new one. Useful if the
                calling script wants a handle on the context to be able to close it later.


    Returns: ZMQ socket. Can recv() or send_json(), depending on whether it's a publisher or subscriber.
